Columbia - a music composition aid for the iPad

For my Bachelors thesis, a non-mimicking musical interface with an integrated music composition aid was designed, implemented and evaluated. The music composition aid is based on templates derived from an analysis of a set of pop songs regarding their chord progression in terms of functional theory. The interface and the music composition aid were evaluated in a Thinking-aloud study with six users and analysed with a qualitative approach according to Mayring.

The thesis yields feedback on advantages, disadvantages, usability problems and suggested improvements of a non-mimicking digital musical interface with an integrated music composition aid.

I use the sample-based audio library SoundBankPlayer by Matthijs Hollemans (see SoundBankPlayer.LICENSE.txt and SoundBankPlayer.README.txt).
